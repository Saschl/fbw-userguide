A: Yes, see Downloads . Q: Where is the plane in-sim? A: The mod is added on top of the default A320neo from Asobo. If you want to uninstall it and revert to the original aircraft, just delete the A32NX folder in your community folder. Q: What are the liveries available? A: All liveries for the default A320 are compatible with the A32NX Mod. You can download some of your favourite liveries at Flightsim.to . Q: When will it be released? A: The project is an ongoing rolling release. See Downloads . Q: When is the next update? A: We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each Stable build update via discord and our social media: Facebook , Twitter . Q: How do I join the team? A: Head over to Contributing.md and join our Discord to get started. Q: Is it payware? A: No, it is a completely free aircraft, open-source. Q: How do we report bugs? A: Report bugs to us in the Discord server , under the #help channel, or by creating a GitHub issue. Just make sure to search for existing issues first before creating a new one. Q: Why is my version not the same as what I see others using? A: We have two versions, the Stable and Developer (Master). The Stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator. The Developer build is updated daily and is a constant work in progress and although we test thoroughly each update, minor issues may occur from time to time. If you find this to be the case, you can report these issues in #help in discord or via GitHub Issues (Check there is not an existing issue of the same nature as yours).","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"guide/","text":"Installation guide Please follow the information on this page to install the FlyByWire Simulations A32NX Mod for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 Downloads A32NX Installer Download the new A32NX installer where you can select either the Stable or Developer build, and download and install the mod directly into your community folder, download here ( source ).
