# Airliner Flying Hints and Tips

This is a rough basic guide to general airliner terminology and flying techniques that can be generally applied to most aircraft in the simulator, with a focus towards the Airbus A320 Family and the FBW A32NX mod.

## Types of Approaches Available

To land any aircraft, the first step is to start an approach that will bring you to a position where you can see the runway. There are a multitude of different approaches, divided into three terms, precision, non-precision and approach with vertical guidance.

Depending on what equipment the airfield has, what the aircraft is capable of, what the pilot is certified to do and the weather that is on the airfield will determine which of these approaches you will do. Here are some of the more common ones you may see in an airliner.

### Precision Approaches \(PA\)

A precision approach will give you full guidance, both vertically and laterally, to guide you down to a point where you can see the runway. This information can come from a set of radio beacons on the ground, satellite information or from a controller.

| Approach Type | Equipment Used | Used For |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :--------: |
| Instrument Landing System \(ILS\) | A localiser and glideslope radio beacon | Most precise available, the most common for airliner operations.|
| GBAS Landing System \(GLS\) | GPS Satellite systems and ground transmitters | A new alternative to ILS, for difficult approaches |
| Surveillance Radar Approach \(SRA\) | A radar dish and a controller | Commonly as a backup, or at military airfields |

Using a localiser beacon at the end of the runway, and a glisdeslop beacon at the side, the aircraft is guided along two radio signals to the touchdown point. These can be accurate enough to position the aircraft all the way down to touchdown and steer it along the runway. The pilots need to tune the ILS frequency into their aircraft's radio navigation system to receive the correct signals.

#### GLS

Like an ILS, but instead of using a set of radio beacons, the aircraft is guided by being fed information from a set of ground stations, which are in turn fed details about the position of the aircraft through GPS satellites.

Not common, but as they do not need radio signals that go out in straight lines, the station can guide the aircraft around curves and turns to avoid terrain and built up/sensitive areas. Only some aircraft are equipped to do GLS and is only an option on the A320 family.

#### SRA

This is an approach where a controller, with an advanced radar, steers you towards the runway while telling you corrections to your heading or altitude. To the pilot, the controller will give you corrections such as, “Left 2 degrees”, “Right 3 degrees”, “Slightly high, correcting”, to bring you towards the runway.

When all other systems fail, this system can be used as a backup to provide these kinds of approaches, and several large international airports will practice these to keep the controllers skills current. Military airfields commonly use them as they can be setup much quicker than an ILS for use in temporary airfields and only rely on a radar, which can be portable.

### Non-Precision Approaches \(NPA\)

A non-precision approach officially can only give you lateral guidance to the point where you can see the runway. This is fed either to the pilots either using a single radio beacon or by satellite navigation, but these cannot tell you if you are too high or low. The only way is to use a table off an aviation chart that shows you at what altitude you need to be at certain distances.

| Approach Type | Equipment Used | Used For |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :--------: |
| Localiser Only \(LOC\) | A localiser that would be part of an ILS system normally | Some airports only have localiser but also when ILS glideslopes have failed. |
| VOR-DME or VOR Only | A VOR beacon with/without a distance from a DME | Old style approaches, where ILS cannot be used. |
| NDB-DME or DME Only | A NDB beacon with/without a distance from a DME | Old style approaches, where an ILS cannot be used |
| LNAV Only | GPS or the Aircrafts position inside the flight management computers | Approaches where there are no radio beacons in the area |
| Visual | Pilots eyeball! | Where there is no issue with the weather and the runway is already in sight |

These approaches are all flown traditionally with just a beacon pointer or the localiser giving left/right corrections. With a helpful co-pilot who will be using the altitude table to check if you are high or low, you keep correcting down towards the runway. As the term non-precision hints, these approaches are nowhere near as accurate as a precision approach and as such can require quite good weather to be able to attempt them. VOR and NBD beacons are slowly disappearing due to maintenance costs and the more useful APV approaches being made available.

***

### Approaches with Vertical Guidance \(APV\)

A newer kind of approach, that uses both lateral and vertical guidance from sources such as GPS satellites, and does not require the use of radio beacons at all. At time of writing, these approaches were not yet classed as precision, as they do not quite have the accuracy required but are constantly getting better with each new design. They are now flown very similarly to an ILS and do not require much input from the pilots.

| Approach Type | Equipment Used | Used For |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :--------: |
| RNP/RNAV | Satellite GPS systems and the aircrafts on board positioning system | Approaches where there are no radio beacons in the area |
| RNP-AR | Satellite GPS systems and the aircrafts onboard positioning system | As per RNP/RNAV but allow curved approaches with margins as little as 0.1 NM. |

## The Different Categories of ILS

With the ILS system, there are several categories that have different requirements from the pilots, the aircraft, the weather and the airport equipment. They are known as CAT, short for category, and are listed as both roman numerals and Latin numbers:

| ILS Category | Autoland Required <br>\(in the Airbus\)</br> | Weather <br>\(Normally\)</br> | MDA or DH |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: | :----------: |
| CAT 1 / CAT I | No <br>\(May also be unsafe due to interference\)</br> | Cloud base above 200ft <br>Visibility 550m</br> | MDA |
| CAT 1 LTS / CAT I LTS <br>\(Lower Than Standard\)</br> | Yes | Cloud base above 200ft <br>Visibility 400m or 450m</br> | MDA |
| CAT 2 / CAT II | Yes | Cloud base above 100ft <br>Visibility 300m</br> | DH |
| CAT 3A / CAT IIIA | Yes | Cloud base above 100ft <br>Visibility 200m</br> | DH |
| CAT 3B / CAT IIIB | Yes \(2 Autopilots\) | Cloud base above 50ft <br>Visibility 75m</br> | DH <br>\(can be 0\)</br> |
| CAT 3C / CAT IIIC | Yes \(2 Autopilots\) | Cloud base above 0ft <br>Visibility 0m</br> | DH <br>\(can be 0\)</br> |


As the weather gets progressively worse, the higher the category you need to use, which in turn
requires more advanced equipment both on the airfield and in the cockpit. To be able to do this,
pilots are required to retrain on low visibility operations every year.

The CAT 3C can be performed without ever seeing anything at all but this is not in practice yet
as there has not been designed a system for the aircraft to be able to leave the runway and go to
the parking stands completely blind. The A320 family are capable of everything including CAT
3C.

## Minimums and MDA/DH

So, you have picked your approach and are flying towards the runway, but how close can you get before you decide it is a bad idea and to try again somewhere else? This is where the minimums come into effect. These are fixed values that decide how low you can go on the approach, and when you get to this altitude, you cannot go any lower until you can see the runway.

| Minimum Type | Defined As | Approaches Used In |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: |
| MDA <br>\(Minimum Decision Altitude\) | Altitude Above Mean Sea Level | CAT 1 / CAT 1 LTS ILS <br> VOR, NDB, RNAV, RNP, Visual, SRA </br> |
| DH <br>\(Decision Height\)</br> | Height Above the Ground | CAT 2 ILS <br> CAT 3 A/B/C ILS </br>

These are defined in feet, \(or meters if that airspace uses meter altitudes\) and can be found at the bottom of the aeronautical chart that is published for that approach. Each approach to each airport will have a separate value, changing due to obstacles, terrain, and other things that may get in the way while descending towards the runway.

***

### Aircraft Approach categories

Now depending on the aircraft you are flying, depends on the minimums you are allowed to use. These are grouped together by the approach speed of your aircraft, while in normal landing configuration at the maximum landing weight that it is certified to do.

* The higher the maximum weight approach speed means:
* The higher category is required, which means:
* The higher minimums are used.

| Aircraft Category | Approach Speeds | Typical Aircraft |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: |
| A | < 91 knots | C172 PA28 SR22 DC3 |
| B | 91 - 120 knots | ATR72 C17 S340 TBM850 |
| C | 121 - 140 knots | A320 A380 737 MD80 |
| D | 141 - 165 knots | A340 A350 747 777 787 MD11 |
| E | 166 - 210 knots | Concorde and specialist military |

### MDA/DH on a chart

**Image goes here**

In the above example, which is for the ILS or LOC/DME for Runway 23 at Buffalo Airport, NY in the USA, this chart uses a format designed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the USA. Each chart designer unfortunately has slight differences compared to each other, but the basics are usually the same. So, for the above approach:

**Follow up Image**

In this example, for Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport, ILS or LOC/DME for runway 26L:

**Chart images go here**

As this chart is now designed differently, it has described the MDA as a DA for the ILS. Now this is just a difference between charts and countries, some use one terminology over the other. Also to note is the inclusion of OCH values. These are the obstacle clearance heights of all possible objects on the approach path, so if you descend below this, then there is a possibility of a collision. These OCH values are not used by the pilots in an approach but are used by the professional bodies who design the approaches as to what the minimums values should be.

## Reading a Chart

### Chart Sample 1
**Full chart \#1 image here with marks for information**

1. The category of aircraft allowed to do this approach \(A, B, C & D\). <br> The altitude of the airfield (392ft) and altitude of the runway touchdown (317ft)
2. A top-down picture of the approach (solid line), go-around (dotted line), dangerous airspace (red area), the airport layout and obsacles nearby. <br> A box in the top-left corner showing local holding waypoints (MOPAR) with speed limits (230 knots) and altitude limits (between FL070 and FL110).
3. The transition altitude (5000ft).
4. The missed approach described in text form.
5. The minimums box for this approach.
6. A box describing, depending on your groundspeed, how long it will take you to get to the runway from the first point you start to descend and what vertical speed is expected.
7. The ILS frequency (108.35), its identifier (DSU) and that is has a DME linked to it. <br> The magnetic variation of the area (0 degrees).
8. Special notes for this approach that may be different than normal.
9. A side-on view of the approach, with starting altitude (4000ft), inbound course (265 degrees), slope of the glideslope (3.0) and distances to the runway for several points along the bottom.
10. A distance-altitude check box, where the altitude you should be at for different distances is described. This is useful to check in case there are any issues with any of the radio beacons you are using.

!!! info "NOTE"
    All approach charts, no matter the designer, will have this information provided to you as a bare minimum.

    However, the layout may be significantly different, so a quick 5 minutes to look at the charge can make all the difference before starting an approach.

4. The names of the arrivals and where they terminate (AMIKI).
5. The location of the waypoint (NEGRA) defined by radio beacons (TRA & KLO), by the distance and direction from each of them (track 087 at 40.2 nautical miles/track 066 at 39.2 nautical miles).
6. The initial approach fix or IAF (AMIKI), which is normally where the arrival will end and the approach chart will start from.
7. A text description of the route for each arrival.
8. Special notes for this arrival that may be diffreent than normal.
9. A box with ATC frequency information, the airport altitude (1416 feet) and the transition level and altitude (by ATC/7000ft).
10. The minimum safe altitude (MSA), which below this you are in danger of hitting terrain. This is traditionally based on a 25 nautical mile ring around a VOR beacon (KLO), and different segments are split up by tracks into the beacon.
